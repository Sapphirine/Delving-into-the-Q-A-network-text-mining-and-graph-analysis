thing knowledg linear algebra might help context machin learn dimension reduct lot problem pca special case svd follow simpl machin learn method appli reduc dataset produc much better result non parametr model full non reduc dataset exampl see bhat zaelit 2012 pca follow linear regress perform better involv non parametr model also suggest reason dimension reduct perform better case visual data higher dimension data complic visual one often need abl reduc dimens dataset view come handi one view result cluster higher dimension dataset numer accuraci eigenvalu gener handi order understand condit number matric henc abl figur result linear regress method requir solv ax b would numer accur posit definit matrix might also abl guarante bound numer accuraci recommend method like collabor filter use matrix factor svd tune smartli solv recommend problem regular regular commonli use reduc fit machin learn problem regular techniqu like lasso tikhonov etc optim linear algebra heart
