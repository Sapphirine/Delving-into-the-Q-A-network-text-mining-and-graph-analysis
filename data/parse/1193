restrict two approach ? re cool ? would alway start simpl linear classifi regressor case linear svm logist regress prefer algorithm implement take advantag sparsiti due size data take long time run dl algorithm dataset would normal tri deep learn specialist problem hierarch structur data imag text overkil lot simpler learn problem take lot time expertis learn also dl algorithm slow train addit 50m row doesn mean need use entir dataset get good result depend data may get good result sampl 100 000 row million would start simpl small sampl linear classifi get complic result satisfactori least way ll get baselin ve often found simpl linear model perform sophist model task want alway start
