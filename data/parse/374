guess say want use 3 fold cross valid know someth data use k 10 would caus overfit ? m curiou reason sure know simpli use larger k still think cannot use standard k fold cross valid could modifi algorithm bit say split data 30 fold time use 20 train 10 evalu shift one fold use first last 9 evalu rest train mean re abl use data use k fold cross valid usual run process multipl time differ randomis make sure suffici data see differ perform depend randomis case would suggest sampl trick often enough
